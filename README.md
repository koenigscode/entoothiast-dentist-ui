# Dentist UI

This is the CLI for dentists (and admins):

- If you log in as a dentist, you can manage appointments, timeslots, view your notifications etc.
  - you can use the credentials `dentist1`/`test` if using the test data
- If you log in as an admin , you can manage clinics, view logs, view statistics, etc.
  - you can use the credentials `admin1`/`test` if using the test data

Reminder: _test data is automatically inserted if you ran `npm run compose:up`, and not `compose-prod:up`_

## Running the CLI

```bash
npm start
```
